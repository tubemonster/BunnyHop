Hey guys! This README file is officially our first document stored in our git repository! woohoo :D

Anyways, some things that might be helpful:

1) I added you guys as collaborators to this repo so you should have read/write access to the master branch

2) http://gitref.org/
this reference guide has a simple list of a few useful git commands that we can start using try some of them out!

3) http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/21/pushing-and-pulling.html
This might help explain what all the git commands are doing xD
