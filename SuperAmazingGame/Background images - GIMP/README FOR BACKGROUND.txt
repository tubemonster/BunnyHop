PLEASE ONLY USE BACKGROUND 1,2,3 ETC.

DON'T USE THE OTHER BACKGROUNDS BECAUSE THE COLOURS ARE DIFFERENT :)


*******************************************

Start with background1 then continue to background 6 then repeat, all these should stitch smoothly. For example 1 connects to 2, 2 connects to 3 ...... then 6 connects back to 1.
